					The Earth has been home to some amazing creatures.  One example is Andrewsarchus, an enigmatic beast who lived during the Eocene epoch (32-60 million years ago) in what is modern Mongolia.  Known only from a single skull specimen discovered by Kan Chuen Pao in 1923, Andrewsarchus is the largest terrestrial carnivore yet discovered.  This enormous skull, lined with the unmistakable sturdy, sharp teeth of a meat eater, is on display at the American Natural History in New York.  The skull is 32.8 inches long.  A large grizzly bear’s skull, in comparison, measures around 15 inches long.  Andrewsarchus would have dwarfed a full-grown male grizzly.  Although Andrewsarchus’ definitive form is not known, based on the dimensions of the skull, it must have been a very large animal.  Regardless of its overall body size, Andrewsarchus was a formidable mammal that dwarfed any carnivore known.

					The skull of Andrewsarchus nominally resembles those of modern wolves.  It must have given the animal a tremendous bite force.  However, Andrewsarchus was not a close relative of modern wolves.  There is evidence that its ancestors were, in fact, herbivores.  Without the rest of the skeleton, it has proven difficult for scientists to classify Andrewsarchus.  Most paleontologists believe Andrewsarchus was an artiodactyl, or even-toed mammal, in the same family as bison, giraffes, camels, hippos, and interestingly- whales.  Andrewsarchus may have been what is known as a hippomorph.  Its exact diet is not known.  The type specimen skull was found near what was an ancient shoreline, so it is possible Andrewsarchus would have used its immense jaws to crush the shells of turtles and mollusks in addition to feeding on the large herbivorous mammals of the Eocene.

					It is possible that Andrewsarchus was an opportunistic omnivore.  Physically, it may resemble the so-called “hell pigs” or entelodonts, intimidating animals believed also to be relatives of hippos and whales.  It is logical to posit that the resemblance of these two animals- entelodonts also have enormous skulls and and array of sharp teeth- suggests they may have shared a similar life style.  Andrewsarchus’ heavy skull would have required powerful neck muscles to provide it the necessary support.  It is possible that Andrewsarchus, as with the entelodonts, had bones that extended vertically above its spinal column in a kind of “crest,” to provide more spatial area for muscle attachment.  Until a more complete specimen is discovered, science can only conjecture as to the body form of Andrewsarchus.  With its fearsome skull and carnivore’s teeth, regardless of the nature of its final shape, Andrewsarchus was definitely an impressive, and quite dangerous, animal.

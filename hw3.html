				Here are two images I uploaded to my site.  The first  image was not altered in any way.  Utilizing the site https://imagecompressor.com/, I applied a -19% compression to the original image which rendered a compressed image file. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At first glance, there appears to be little, if any, difference between the two images.  Upon closer examination of the altered image, the effect of the compression does become evident.  The color tones of the modified image are slightly deeper, and shadow areas have darkened slightly as a result of the compression.  
			</p>
			<p>
				These minor variances would probably not be obvious to the majority of people visiting the site.  In fact, after the compression, initially I did not notice any marked disparity between the two images.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Noted above are the specs for each image. You may want to take note that all parameters of the specs are identical with the exception of the kilobytes.

<!-- Homework 3 - Working with images, todo check list:
		1)  Insert a heading such as "Working with images"
		2)  insert an image of a landscape, or an image you shot using your cell phone camera. Take note of the size of the image (width, height, and number of bytes). Use the <figure> tag so you can use the <figcaption> tag where you will write the width, height, and number of bytes of that image
		3)  You will insert again that same image but after you compress/optimize and, in the figcaption you will write the width, height, and number of bytes of that new optimized image
		4)  After the two images, you will write a paragraph where you will mention the tool used to compress/optimize the image, and you will create a hyperlink to that tool you used. You will also mention, in that paragraph, if you saw any improvement in the download time of the image and that page after you optimized the image (remember that you can use Chrome Developer Tools to check the download time of each image).
		5) vakidate code W3C

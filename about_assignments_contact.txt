About me page:

	My name is Stephanie, and I am a mixed-media artist with an emphasis on photography.  I am passionate about programming, and am on track to becoming a full-stack engineer.  While attending Hackbright (a woman's bootcamp that focuses on full-stack engineering, and used such tech languages/tools as Python, Flask, PSQL and more), I realized that fine art and programming are not so different after all.  Both involve creative thinking and constant innovative problem solving.  While interning at HiredClub as full-stack engineer as well as staff photographer, and interning at CCSF as a Data Security Analyst, my love of programming intensified.  I am anticipating completing a CS degree, and beginning a career as a full-stack engineer after earning an AS degree and Web Development Certificate.  I am looking forward to bringing my unique, artistic vision to the world of programming.

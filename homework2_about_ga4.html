				<h2>Brief Itroducttion to Google Data Analitics</h2>
				<h6>(a specific focus on Reports Snapshot dashboard/user and user behaivior)</h6>

				<!-- <img class="image_me" src="reports_snapshot_ga4.jpeg" alt="Reports snapshot"> -->
				
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					In the following, we will focus on the data measuring features found in the GA/GA4 Reports Snapshot, as seen above.  We will review the following overarching metrics: user volume, user activities, channel groupings, and the identification of the modes of visitors to the site.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Widget chart of Users, Engagement, and Total Revenue:</h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					On the chart are the metrics categories “Users,” “New Users,” “Average Engagement,” and “Total Revenue.”  The chart’s numbers reflect website traffic as well as duration of user visits.  The metrics also record the category of the user.  This particular chart shows site activity from May 15th to June 5th.  This data is useful in order to track user trends and patterns, and will enable us to take steps to ensure the maximum number of [users] visitors, and maximum engagement of those [users] visitors to the site.]]
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>The four main Metrics- “Users,” “New Users,” “Engagement,” and “Total Revenue,” examined:</h4>
				<br>
				<p>	
					Visitors to the site are classified as “Users” or “New Users” depending upon the nature of their visit.  Utilizing the cookie tracking method, GA/GA4 is able to recognize and record the category of each user’s visit- whether they are a first-time or repeat visitor.  When a user visits the site, a cookie is attached to their browser.  Via these cookies, Google can keep count of and differentiate between the new and repeat users.  The cookies will track the user’s activity, provided that the user has not cleared their browser, moved to a different browser, or begun using a different device.  
				</p>
				<br>	
				<p>
					“Average Engagement time” is a specific kind of metric used by Google Analytics to record variables within a user’s visit to a website linked to GA or GA4.  The metrics document the user’s initial engagement of the site, the duration of their visit, and their activities while on the site.  This information will help us identify what are the most effective aspects of the website, and can be used to implement changes that can be made to the site to ensure maximum user traffic as well as duration of user engagement.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Ecommerce activity is recorded whenever a user purchasing event has occurred.  In this way, valuable “Total Revenue” data can be specifically tracked, and is kept separate from other user activity.  The “Event Value” metric allows us to gather data on the nature of user activity, i.e. whether or not a purchase has been made by the visiting user.  Volume and nature of sales are recorded, and this information can also be utilized to improve the site, enabling the highest profit in sales.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Meaning of “Direct,” “Organic Search,” and “Referral”- Default Channel Groups</h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					“Default Channel Groups” define how a first-time user has arrived at a website.  This data is important, as what it reveals will assist in maintaining the maximum effectiveness of the site.  If a user is categorized as “Direct," they found the site by typing the URL directly into their browser, or they utilized a link in a related Word document or PDF, or accessed the site via a browser bookmark.  If the user is classified as “Organic Search,” they used a search engine, such as Google, to find the site.  “Referral” means the user was on another website, and came across a link that [routed] them to our website.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					It is important to pay extra attention to the first two modes of access, Direct and Organic Search, as those methods generate the highest quantity of New Users.  We will also want to note the least successful of the modalities of New Users acquisition, as these findings will also be useful.   
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The Default Channel Groups data provides us with valuable information which can then be utilized to ensure that we are building, and maintaining, the most user-friendly and successful website possible.

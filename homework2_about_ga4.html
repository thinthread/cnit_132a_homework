				<h2>Brief Itroducttion to Google Data Analitics</h2>
				<h6>(a specific focus on Reports Snapshot dashboard/user and user behaivior)</h6>

				<!-- <img class="image_me" src="reports_snapshot_ga4.jpeg" alt="Reports snapshot"> -->
				
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					In the following, we will focus on the data measuring features found in the GA/GA4 Reports snapshot dashboard, as seen above.  We will review the following overarching metrics: user volume, user activities, channel groupings, and the identification of the modes of visitors to the site.  

				</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Widget chart of Users, Engagement, and Total Revenue:</h4>
				<p>
					At the top left of the Reports snapshot widget board are the metrics “Users,” “New Users,” “Average Engagement,” and “Total Revenue.”  The widget chart is also listing numbers which correspond to the activity [on the website] for each category in a specific time period.  This particular chart shows site activity from May 15th to June 5th.  By selecting different metrics within the chart, we can view distinct user events and trends, and track their duration.  The metrics also record the frequency and nature of user visits and identify user categories.  [This data is useful in order to track user trends and patterns, and will enable us to take steps to ensure the maximum number of [users] visitors, and maximum engagement of those [users] visitors to the site.] 

				</p>
				<br>
				<h4> The four main Metrics, examined:</h4>
				<p>	
					Visitors to the site are classified as “Users” or “New Users” depending upon the nature of their visit.  Utilizing the cookie tracking method, GA/GA4 is able to recognize and record the category of each user’s visit.  When a user visits the site, a cookie is [attached] [placed within] their browser.  Google is then able to keep count of as well as differentiate between new and repeat users.  These cookies record the user's activity providing the user has not cleared their browser, moved to a different browser, or begun using a different device.  Cookies are an effective [and helpful] means of tracking users, and the category of the users, during their visits to the site.  
				</p>	
				<br>
				<p>
					“Average engagement time” is a specific kind of metric, or quantitative measurement, used by Google Analytics to record variables within a user’s visit to a website linked to GA or GA4.  Via these metrics, Google measures events [and conversion events] triggered by the user during their time spent on the site.  These triggers provide a record of the site being initially loaded by the user, the user’s scrolling activities within the site, if links or subsequent pages have been accessed during their visit to the site, and [other important information.] 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Using this data, we are able to keep track of the frequency of visitors [users] to the site, the measurement of the duration of the user’s visit, as well as the nature of the user's activities while on the site.  These metrics provide us with valuable information that help us in the identification of the most effective aspects of the website.  We will also use this data to ascertain what changes could be made to the site that will result in maximum [traffic] [users] to the site, and the longest user engagement time. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Ecommerce activity is indicated as “Total Revenue” on the widget board.  Ecommerce activity is recorded whenever a user purchasing event has occurred.  In this way, valuable Total Revenue data can be specifically tracked, and is kept  separate from other user [customer] activity events on the site.  Implementing the “Event Value” metric allows us to gather data on the nature of user activity on the site, i.e. whether or not a purchase has been made by the visiting user.  Volume and nature of sales are recorded, and this information can also be utilized to make changes to the site, enabling the most profitable sales to be made.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					So, in one simple chart, these metrics are able to provide us with invaluable data that can ensure we are building, and maintaining, the most user-friendly and successful website possible.

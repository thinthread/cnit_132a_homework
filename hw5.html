<!-- Searchablility optimization:

	search and globalization are served better with semantics 

	semantics promotes interoperability, allowing the exchanfe of informaiton acress different platforms and devices

	for the hearing and/or visially impaired

	NVDA voice activated program


	Structure Semantics:
		USE:  
			header, nav, article, section, aside, footer elements:
				these provide additional meaning ti the web browser and devices


				note: 
					banner is the header element
			
					use span and div and section when trying to control the color of something
					place these elements inside of a header or main or some other meaningfull element


				
			<a> tags vrs <button tag:
					for visually impared, is using <a> tag:
						<a> roll="button"</a>
						if  you don't use roll="button", confuses user as they think its going to redirect to new page
						you can only activate links using enter key

						

						best to use button tag for button features, less confusing for visially impared
						you can activate links using enter key or press the spacebar 
						<button aria-expanded="false" aria-expanded="sect1"></button>
								need to use JS with this to change false to true

				visibility:hidden hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout. display:none removes the element from the document. It does not take up any space.
